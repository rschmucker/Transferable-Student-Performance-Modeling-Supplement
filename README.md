# TransferableSPM - Appendix

This GitHub repository serves as appendix for the paper *Transferable Student Performance Modeling for Intelligent Tutoring Systems*. It offers detailed descriptions of the individual features and different student performance models (SPMs) which were evaluated in our experiments. It further provides additional experimental results for the inductive transfer experiments.

<i>Figure 1.</i> How can we use interaction log data from existing courses to train a student model for performance predictions in a new course for which only a little or no interaction log data is available?
